## 🧩 Overview  

PowerToys for macOS brings a collection of powerful utilities designed to streamline productivity and enhance your workflow. Originally created for power users, it offers tools that simplify repetitive tasks, improve multitasking efficiency, and help you get the most out of your Mac.  

The suite includes customizable window management with **FancyZones**, allowing you to quickly organize and snap windows into predefined layouts for optimal workspace usage. This is particularly useful for developers, designers, or anyone juggling multiple applications at once.  

PowerToys also integrates a range of smaller yet impactful utilities, such as quick file renamers, keyboard shortcut editors, and screen rulers. Each component is crafted to make daily tasks smoother and reduce friction in your routine — turning your Mac into a more responsive and efficient workstation.  

Designed with performance and usability in mind, PowerToys runs quietly in the background and is fully optimized for macOS, including Apple Silicon support. Whether you’re working on creative projects, coding, or managing data-heavy workflows, PowerToys provides the versatility and precision you need.
